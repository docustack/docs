If you are logged in as the Tenant administrator, access the Management Console by clicking the stack icon on the top right of the **"File Browser"** view.

    If you are the cluster administrator, you may not see the "Management Console" icon. Instead, you can manage the default tenant from the Cluster Manager -> Tenant Manager and click through to manage the default tenant.
